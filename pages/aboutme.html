            <p class="description">
              I'm a former fashion designer, product developer and business
              owner turned junior software developer. After working for over 20
              years in the fashion industry including owning my own fashion
              label and boutique, I was ready for a new challenge...
              <br /><br />
              Today I work for Mable as a Graduate Software Engineer. Being part
              of an organisation that strives to enhance the lives of elderly or
              disabled individuals by empowering them to make decisions about
              their own support is motivating to me.
              <br /><br />
              I have a passion for problem solving and am particularly
              interested in customer experience and product design. For me,
              empathy is key to being an awesome designer and developer,
              understanding exactly what the user is experiencing when they use
              your product is of the utmost importance and coming up with
              innovative ideas for improving it for them inspires me.<br /><br />
              User testing and research fascinate me. It's about developing a
              product that stands out from your competitors and exceeds user
              expectations.
